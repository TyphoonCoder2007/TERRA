# Terra Stories 🌍✨

**Interactive Data Visualization Hub using NASA Terra Satellite Data**

---

## Overview

**Terra Stories** is a web-based platform developed for the **NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025** by **Team Xplorex**. This website transforms NASA's Terra satellite data into **interactive stories** that highlight environmental changes on Earth.  

I had the opportunity to **build the full website**, integrating interactive maps, animated visualizations, and narrative storytelling to make complex data engaging and understandable.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Maps** 🗺️  
  Visualize “before-and-after” changes in urban growth and deforestation using **ASTER data**.

- **Animated Time-lapses** 🌫️  
  Track the spread of air pollution (**MOPITT data**) and wildfire smoke plumes (**MODIS data**).

- **Glacier & Ice Retreat Tracker** ❄️  
  Observe the shrinking of ice sheets and glaciers over time to illustrate **climate vulnerability**.

- **Narrative Insights** 📖  
  Each visualization is accompanied by a clear, impactful story explaining the environmental changes.

## Technology Stack

- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** – Core web development  
- **D3.js / Chart.js / Three.js** *(optional depending on your visualizations)* – For interactive maps and animations  
- **NASA Open Data (ASTER, MOPITT, MODIS, Terra Satellite)**
